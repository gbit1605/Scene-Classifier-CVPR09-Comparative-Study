# Scene-Classifier-CVPR09-Comparative-Study
Indoor Scene Classification with the CVPR'09 Dataset: A Comparative Study of Custom CNN Architectures, Transfer Learning Strategies, and Visualization Techniques for Enhanced Interpretability 

NOTE: Author was unable to upload the ResNet_V1_model.h5 file due to size limitations on GitHub

* Preprocessed the CVPR'09 dataset, organizing it into the appropriate directory structure and enhancing model generalization through data augmentation techniques.
* Created a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, leveraging TensorFlow's Keras Sequential API for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
* Implemented four state-of-the-art feature extraction models: EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet_V2, ResNet_V1_101, and Inception_V2, to evaluate and compare their classification performance.
* Employed the Keras Functional API in TensorFlow to construct a fine-tuning model using the EfficientNet-B0 as base model.
* Utilized data visualization techniques to enhance project understanding, including the generation of activation maps for in-depth model interpretation.
